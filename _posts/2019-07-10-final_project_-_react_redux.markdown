My final project for Flatiron was definitely the most challenging but also BY FAR the most rewarding. There were many parts where I got stuck or felt like I spend way too much time on a particular feature but overall I learned so much!

The final project app I chose to create is called ReputationMate. The ability to monitor, analyze and influence your personal online reputation on Google and social media is incredibly important in 2019 and moving forward. Employers, friends, and colleagues will most likely Google you at some point and being able to have some bit of control over what appears are ideal. ReputationMate solves this problem by using the Google Custom Search API to query and analyze the results for your desired query while giving suggestions and tips on how to tackle changing your presence onlineâ€¦

I used React/Redux for the app along with a Rails API backed to handle our data collection and database persistence. The react-bootstrap library allowed for a clean user interface and interactive components such as modal popups etc.

ReputationMate was a great project and allowed me to fully utilize all of my skills from the entire FlatIron course!

The next features I want to add:
* Recurring daily/weekly search result monitoring
* Search from several different locations and average results to get an even result set
* Push notifications for flagged URLs that appear
* Automatic social platform querying to see if desired Username(s) are available
